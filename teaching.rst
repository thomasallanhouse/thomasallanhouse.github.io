  "I don't believe I can really do without teaching. The reason is, I have to have
  something so that when I don't have any ideas and I'm not getting anywhere I
  can say to myself, 'At least I'm living; at least I'm *doing*
  something; I'm making *some* contribution' - it's just psychological." -
  *Richard Feynman*.
