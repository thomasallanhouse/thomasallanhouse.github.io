I'm a Professor of Mathematical Sciences in the `Department of Mathematics
<https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/>`__ at the `University of Manchester
<https://www.manchester.ac.uk/>`__.

My work focuses on Mathematical Epidemiology, which is an exciting field that
draws on various areas of the mathematical sciences. During the COVID-19
pandemic, I have mainly been putting this expertise at the service of the
`Government
<https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/scientific-advisory-group-for-emergencies-sage-coronavirus-covid-19-response-membership/list-of-participants-of-sage-and-related-sub-groups>`__,
`ONS
<https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/previousReleases>`__,
and `NHS <https://github.com/thomasallanhouse/covid19-los>`__, making any 
statement of other research interests a bit moot. Nevertheless,
I am currently particularly interested in efficient statistical inference for
these problems, complex data including networks and associated theory,
numerical probability, inverse problems, and model simplification.

Much of the support for COVID-19 work came via the UKRI-funded `JUNIPER
Consortium <https://maths.org/juniper/>`__.

I was recently funded by the `Royal Society
Industry
<https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/industry-fellowship/>`__
scheme `IBM Research
<https://research.ibm.com/labs/uk/>`__ locally, thinking about how we can make
better use of modern computing architectures to solve complex inferential and
modelling problems.  

I am a Fellow of the `Alan Turing Institute <https://www.turing.ac.uk/>`__  and
led the "Turing @ Manchester: Patient Subgroup Discovery" project.  I am also
grateful for past and current funding from `EPSRC
<https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/>`__. 

I also support development of open-source software for epidemic modelling. My
`GitHub is here <https://github.com/thomasallanhouse>`__, and amusingly enough
I'm old enough to have a `SourceForge account
<https://sourceforge.net/u/thouse/profile/>`__. Now there is a great initiative
called `epirecipes <http://epirecip.es/>`__ that will hopefully pull together a
lot of relevant software.
