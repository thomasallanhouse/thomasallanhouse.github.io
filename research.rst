Epidemiology is the science of counting ill people - a simple description that
hides major mathematical complexity. A tremendous number of different factors
combine to determine the risk that any of us might become ill, however if we
could disentangle these from each other then it might be possible to target the
most important factors systematically. My work is mainly on the mathematical,
statistical and computational methods that we need to understand these
phenomena, but I also work on other things as shown in my `Publications <./publications.html>`__.

The following are actually my profiles on different sites, as a way of using this
site to validate my identity, updated with different levels of intensity.
