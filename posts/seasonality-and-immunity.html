    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This blogpost was conceptualised in mid-2021, and should be public
late in 2023. With the problems going on at ùïè (formerly Twitter), it's struck
me that putting any such content on a website that I control probably has its
advantages, so I hope to use this site more going forwards.</p>
<img alt="Spring being pushed, with displacement z from equilibrium" class="align-right" src="../spring.jpg" style="width: 240px;"><p>So let's start by considering a weight on a spring as pictured - this is going
to give us a physical 'model' of disease dynamics for an endemic infection. The
weight on the spring is a distance <span class="raw-html">\(z(t)\)</span> from the point at which
the system would be at rest. There are three forces acting on the weight:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The spring pulls it towards equilibrium, to a first approximation,
proportionally to its spring constant giving a force contribution
<span class="raw-html">\(-k z\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p>As the weight moves, friction dissipates kinetic energy giving a force
contribution <span class="raw-html">\(-\nu \dot{z}\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p>A human is pushing at the weight giving a time-dependent force contribution
<span class="raw-html">\(\varphi(t)\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, dredging up our high-school physics we remember that Newton's equation is
<span class="raw-html">\(F = ma\)</span>. Noting that acceleration is the second derivative of
position so that <span class="raw-html">\(a = \ddot{z}\)</span> and combining the three force
contributions above we get <span class="raw-html">\[-kz - \nu \dot{z} + \varphi(t) = m
\ddot{z}\, .\]</span> Dredging still further, we might remember that momentum is
<span class="raw-html">\(p = m\dot{z}\)</span>, which gives us dynamics <span class="raw-html">\[\dot{z} =
\frac{1}{m} p \, , \qquad \dot{p} = -kz - \frac{\nu}{m} p + \varphi(t) \, .
\qquad \mathrm{(1)} \]</span></p>
<p>Next, let us consider an SIRS model with forcing, <span class="raw-html">\[\dot{S} = \omega
R - \beta(t) S I \, , \quad\ \dot{I} = \beta(t) S I - \gamma I \, , \quad
\dot{R} = \gamma I - \omega R \, .\]</span> This models a system where individuals move
from susceptible to infections upon contact with other infectious individuals,
then recover, and after that immunity wanes and they become susceptible again.
The rate <span class="raw-html">\(\beta(t)\)</span> depending on time is supposed to capture
different exogenous events: schools opening and closing; new vaccines; new
variants; policy changes; and all sorts of other complexity. If you want to
experiment with these equations numerically, check out <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thomasallanhouse/covid19-incidence/blob/main/bmj.ipynb">this Jupyter notebook</a>
that I make available on GitHub.</p>
<p>This set of equations does not have a general closed form, but we can look for
an approximate one using the Ansatz <span class="raw-html">\[S(t) = S_* + \epsilon x(t) \,
, \quad\ I(t) = I_* + \epsilon y(t) \, , \quad R(t) = N - S(t) - I(t) \, ,
\quad \beta(t) = \beta_* + \epsilon \phi(t) \, .\]</span> We want this to correspond
to a fixed point of the dynamical system when <span class="raw-html">\(\epsilon = 0\)</span>,
leading to the equations <span class="raw-html">\[0 = \omega (N - S_* - I_*) - \beta_* S_*
I_* \, , \qquad\ 0 = \beta_* S_* I_* - \gamma I_* \, .\]</span> These have a solution
when <span class="raw-html">\(S_* = N, I_* = 0\)</span> that is unstable if the disease can go endemic,
i.e. when <span class="raw-html">\(\mathcal{R}_0 = \beta_*/\gamma &gt; 1 \)</span>; the other fixed
point is when <span class="raw-html">\(S_* = 1/\mathcal{R}_0\)</span>, which I hope to blog
about later. The expression for the expected number of infectives
<span class="raw-html">\(I_*\)</span> at endemicity is more complex; feel free to derive it for
fun!  For our purposes here, we are interested in what we obtain at first order
in <span class="raw-html">\(\epsilon\)</span>, which gives us <span class="raw-html">\[\dot{x} = - \omega x -
\omega y - \beta_* x I_* - \beta_* S_* y - \phi S_* I_* +
\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)  \, , \qquad\ \dot{y} = \beta_* x I_* + \beta_* S_* y +
\phi S_* I_* - \gamma y  + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2) \, .  \qquad \mathrm{(2)}
\]</span></p>
<p>OK, so take a breath. Now, with a bit of work, we can write both equations (1)
and (2) (neglecting quadratic terms in <span class="raw-html">\(\epsilon\)</span>) above in the
form of a two-dimensional vector differential equation
<span class="raw-html">\[\dot{\mathbf{v}} = \boldsymbol{J} \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{F}(t) \, ,
\qquad \mathrm{(3)} \]</span> where <span class="raw-html">\(\mathbf{v}\)</span> is a vector containing
the dynamical variables - <span class="raw-html">\((z,p)\)</span> for the spring and
<span class="raw-html">\((x,y)\)</span> for the SIRS model - <span class="raw-html">\(\boldsymbol{J}\)</span> is a
matrix depending on rate constants, and <span class="raw-html">\(\mathbf{F}(t)\)</span> is a
vector function of time. Some readers will note that the details of the
versions of (3) derived from (1) and (2) are not quite the same, but also that
equation (3) takes the same structure under the linear transformation
<span class="raw-html">\[\tilde{\mathbf{v}} = \boldsymbol{T} \mathbf{v} \, ,\quad
\tilde{\boldsymbol{J}} = \boldsymbol{T}\boldsymbol{J}\boldsymbol{T}^{-1} \,
,\quad \tilde{\mathbf{F}} = \boldsymbol{T} \mathbf{F} \, . \]</span> They might also
have fun trying to work with (3) via matrix integrating factor, Eigensystem
analysis, or maybe Fourier transform.</p>
<p>So, that was quite fiddly (although not much beyond high-school level
mathematics apart from the last bit). But the TL;DR is this: imagine all the
complexity that you can generate by bouncing a weight up and down. If your taps
line up just right with the how the spring behaves, you can get regular
oscillations, but it's not difficult to make the weight jump irregularly all
over the place. And this is exactly what we can see with an endemic disease:
there's no guarantee that oscillatory behaviour will be regular or predictable.</p>
<p>Now, for many diseases that are better established, we do indeed see relatively
regular annual peaks, although predicting the exact timing and height of these
even for very well studied diseases like influenza is not currently possible.
But most experts think that the relative regularity of influenza compared to
COVID arises because the exogenous forces are mainly annual events like school
holidays, people moving in and outdoors with the weather, and maybe even a
direct bio-physical impact of the weather, with evolutionary events generally
having a less dramatic impact on disease transmission than they do for COVID.</p>
<p>Because evolution is hard to predict, it's not clear that COVID will become
more like influenza. Or even that it would be a good thing if it did. The
purpose of this post, however, was to help explain why its unpredictability is
at least somewhat predictable.</p>
