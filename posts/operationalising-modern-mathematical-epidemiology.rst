This month Liz Buckingham-Jeffery is joining me and Tim Kinyanjui to complete
the team for the EPSRC-funded project *Operationalising Modern Mathematical
Epidemiology*, which is a Healthcare Technologies Impact Fellowship I hold
(picture of us all below). The project is about development of some recent
ideas at developed by mathematical scientists to generate benefits in the
healthcare system.  We have non-academic partners from three major Manchester
hospitals (Central Manchester, North Manchester and the Christie), Public
Health England's national Real-time Syndromic Surveillance group, and a data
analytics firm Spectra Analytics. The first papers from this project are
starting be be submitted, and we have an ambitious programme of research and
impact-related activity over the next couple of years to ensure that the
potential benefits to population health from theoretical developments are
realised.
