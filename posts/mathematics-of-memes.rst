Models of epidemics can be adapted to consider the spread of internet Memes - for more information see
the University `Press Release
<http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/the-maths-behind-memes-why-numbers-could-help-us-predict-an-internet-sensation/>`__.
Below is a figure showing some of these Memes 'in the wild'! We hope that the work will be possible to extend
to more substantial health-related behaviours, but Memes provide a relatively pure signal of the kind
of social influence that must be accounted for in such contexts, and as such are a good way to develop methods.

I also recently gave a talk at the local Galois Group (undergraduate mathematics) on the work:
