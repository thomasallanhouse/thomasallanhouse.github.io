I was a long-term participant in the `Infectious Disease Dynamics
<http://www.newton.ac.uk/event/IDD>`__ programme at the Newton Institute.

This experience had a large effect on my thinking about the field, and allowed
me to start new collaborations. One of the things that we did together is write
the review paper `Modeling infectious disease dynamics in the complex landscape
of global health
<http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6227/aaa4339.abstract>`__, which has
just appeared in its final form. While the lead author, `Hans Heesterbeek
<http://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/JAPHeesterbeek>`__, did the really hard work of
pulling everything together, the paper comes remarkably close to a consensus
view of the most exciting directions in infectious disease modelling, and it's
a good starting point for someone thinking about making contributions to this
field.
