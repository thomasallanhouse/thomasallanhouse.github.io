I'm a Professor of Mathematical Sciences in the `Department of Mathematics
<https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/>`__ at the `University of Manchester
<https://www.manchester.ac.uk/>`__.

My work focuses on Mathematical Epidemiology, which is an exciting field that
draws on various areas of the mathematical sciences, and which played a key
role in helping to respond to COVID-19. I am currently particularly interested
in efficient statistical inference for epidemiological problems, complex data
including networks and associated theory, numerical probability, the interface
with social science, and model simplification.

Much of the support for COVID-19 work came via the UKRI-funded `JUNIPER
Consortium <https://maths.org/juniper/>`__.  I support development of
open-source, modular software for epidemic modelling and in science more
generally.
